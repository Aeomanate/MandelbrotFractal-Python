# MandelbrotFractal-Python
Mandelbrot fractal for fun.

It first attempt to create this fractal.

Amazing that usage builtin complex() class are faster than naive implement complex numbers multiplications. On C++ usage std::complex slowest than naive implementation multiplication of complex numbers.

As I did got it later the python and pygame aren't fit to draw separates pixels. So thereat I had rewrited it fractal on C++

### Used instruments

* PyGame 1.9.6

### How to run
* Install the appropriate PyGame 
* Just copy-paste my code into interpreter
